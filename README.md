## Overview

This project implements an **object-oriented simulation** where players defend an ant colony against invading bees.  
It models inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism through various ant and bee types, each with unique attributes and abilities.

## Key Features
- **Object-Oriented Design** — custom classes for Ants, Bees, and GameState.  
- **Turn-based Simulation** — manages colony health, food resources, and attack sequences.  
- **Multiple Ant Types** — HarvesterAnt, ThrowerAnt, FireAnt, QueenAnt, and more.  
- **Modular Codebase** — easy to expand with new ant types or behaviors.  
- **GUI Support** — playable visual interface via `gui.py`.
